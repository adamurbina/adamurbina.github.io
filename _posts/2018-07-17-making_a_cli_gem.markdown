The hardest part of this process was definitely the planning and organization of the gem. Figuring out what the objects should be and how they should interact took far more time than the actual code writing itself. I found that once I took out an actual sheet of paper and drew out (with a pen!) what the objects should be and what they should do, it was easier to then sit at the computer and write the code. While I was writing the code and adding features I found it beneficial to consistently ask myself “whose responsibility should this be?” This made it easier to think through where and how properties and methods should be implemented.
