Sessions are an important way to persist information in a stateless protocol. It is kind of a work around for creating web apps that need information to go back and forth between the user and the server. Sessions can be used to identify you and recall what you’ve been doing on a particular website so that information can be passed on between different requests. Without sessions a user’s experience on the web would be quite frustrating!
