I learned a couple of interesting lessons while putting together my little web app. First I learned that while I can conceptually understand everything that goes into building an app, so much of the execution is dependent on coming up with a clean organization and logic of the entire code base. This means paying attention to what routes lead where and which controller does what and how. I also kept wondering if there were more helper methods that I could have been writing to help keep the controllers clean and readable even while they do more and more.

The second lesson I learned is just how important front-end design is. I would say that 95% of my time learning code has been focused on the back end. But the front-end is just as important, if not more important. If the data coming out of the back-end is not displayed in a way that is easy for people to interact with, then the whole project almost doesnâ€™t matter. Front-end design is definitely a weak spot for me and something that I need to pay more attention to going forward.
