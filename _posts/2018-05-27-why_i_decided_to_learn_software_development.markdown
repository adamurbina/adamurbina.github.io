My interest in software development began like many others. I had mundane repetitive tasks that I had to do at work and wondered if there was a quicker better way. Once I had to copy and paste the names and dates of thousands of files into an Excel spreadsheet. Not knowing how to do this quickly I googled around and came up with a little shell command to get the task done. But it sparked some interest. What was this shell and what other things could it do? My interest grew the more I learned and continues to grow as I dive into all things tech. I have gotten better at writing VBA for work projects and am excited about what else I could build, the more I learn.
