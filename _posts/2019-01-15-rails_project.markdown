The main takeaway I got from doing the Rails project is that this is going to be a work in progress. I opted to build a web app for an actual web application I would use at work. The app is a job tracking system for multiple employees. The employees can see what jobs are assigned to them and who the clients are. I have already built something similar in Microsoft Excel, however, so I know the must have features. There are so many things that I would like the app to do that would take much more time to develop. I would also like to spend more time on the aesthetics and the UI, something that I’ve struggled with and haven’t paid much attention to as much of my focus has been on the backend development. I may submit the homework to move on with the bootcamp lessons but spend more time on the side buliding out the app to something that I feel functions the way that it should.
