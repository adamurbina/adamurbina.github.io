I found that scraping gets easier the more familiar you become with HTML/CSS (obviously!). However, so much of my own learning has been centered around Ruby and Python and backend development that sometimes the front-end stuff is lost. We kind of touch on it and move along. With scraping you are pulling all the HTML from a website and using your familiarity with HTML and CSS to find what youâ€™re looking for. The more comfortable I am with HTML the easier this process becomes.
