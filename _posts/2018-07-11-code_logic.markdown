It seems that most code consists primarily of if/then logic. If something is true do this thing, else do something else or nothing at all. Doesn’t so much of life function this way? When some condition is met some action is taken. If the weather is nice go for a bike ride else stay inside. If it’s a weekday go to work, else if it is Saturday hang out with friends, else do chores around the house, etc. The process of coming up with good code is also similar to coming up with good habits in life. A programmer not only has to think through how the code should handle common or expected scenarios but also corner cases. Similarly life throws curve balls and a good system of habits or a good moral compass will be robust enough to handle those as well.
